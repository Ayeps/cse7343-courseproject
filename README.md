### OS Process and Resource Management

This program is a visualization of operating system processes and queues as they are managed by a scheduler. It represents a simulation of an operating system as it executes processes, manages multiple queues, and manages memory.

It uses a doubly-linked list to represent process queues, and first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit algorithms for managing memory.

The visualization is created with the Processing library.
