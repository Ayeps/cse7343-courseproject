    Simulator.java
    @author Yong Joseph Bakos

    This class represents an abstract main entry point of the simulation, and
    prepares all of the necessary structures and instances. Processing's `PApplet.main`
    function will call `setup`, and then call `draw` over and over again.

    For the sake of this simulation, you can consider the repetitive calls to draw a
    complete fetch-execute cycle (or tick-tock) of the CPU.

    This simulation uses a very naive, implicit round-robin scheduler that lets each
    active process execute for 30 cycles before being placed at the back of the ready
    queue.

    The screen itself displays instructions for the user (see README.md) for details.
